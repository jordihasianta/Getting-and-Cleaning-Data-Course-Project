The data is taken from [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). 
This dataset provide the following variables for each activity:
  1. *subject* - ID of participant
  2. *activity* - ID of activity type
  3. Mean and standart deviation for the following features (other values are presented in initial dataset, but for this reasearch only these parameters were used)
      * tBodyAcc-XYZ
      * tGravityAcc-XYZ
      * tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
      * tBodyGyro-XYZ
      * tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
      * tBodyAccMag
      * tGravityAccMag
      * tBodyAccJerkMag
      * tBodyGyroMag
      * tBodyGyroJerkMag
      * fBodyAcc-XYZ
      * fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
      * fBodyGyro-XYZ
      * fBodyAccMag
      * fBodyAccJerkMag
      * fBodyGyroMag
      * fBodyGyroJerkMag
      
The features come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
